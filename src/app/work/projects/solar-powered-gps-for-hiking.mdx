A personal engineering challenge born from my love of hiking: a rugged, solar-powered GPS tracker built on an Arduino Nano. It delivers high-precision positioning in UTM coordinates and stays operational indefinitely with solar charging.

## Overview

This device reads GPS data‚Äîlatitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and signal strength‚Äîfrom a GPS module, processes the coordinates into **UTM** for compatibility with **IGN hiking maps**, and displays everything on a compact OLED screen. With its solar charger and battery, it never loses power in the field.

The full code, PCB schematics, and wiring details are available on GitHub: [Arduino-GPS-Display](https://github.com/AlexyDarius/Arduino-GPS-Display)

## Key Achievements

- üõ∞Ô∏è Real-time display of GPS data: lat/lon, altitude, heading, speed, signal strength  
- üîÅ Custom C++ routines for **lat/long ‚Üí UTM** transformation with matrix math  
- ‚òÄÔ∏è Fully solar-powered via charging module + Lipo battery  
- üéØ Achieves **¬±5‚ÄØm accuracy** in mountain environment, vital for terrain navigation  
- ‚ö° Optimized for **2kB RAM*, decoupling complex math from display logic  

## Key Features

- **Arduino Nano (32‚ÄØKB flash, 2‚ÄØKB SRAM)** ‚Äî extreme memory constraints drove careful optimizations  
- **GPS Module** (Quectel L80RE), connected via serial  
- **OLED Display** (I¬≤C) showing all live data in a compact layout  
- **Solar Charging Circuit** with TP4056 charger and panel for sustainable operation  
- **Coordinate Conversion** implemented using matrix transformations directly in C++  
- **Memory Optimization**: separate routines handle display vs. computation to minimize stack usage  

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino Nano**, **C++**, direct AVR register usage  
- **TinyGPS++** for parsing GPS sentences  
- Custom **matrix-based UTM conversion** routines  
- **I¬≤C OLED** Adafruit SSD1306  
- **Solar Li-Po power system** with charger/control  
- **GitHub repo** with full source, wiring diagrams, and usage documentation  

## Challenges & Learnings

- Managing complex geodetic math (latitude/longitude ‚Üí UTM) in limited flash and RAM  
- Dividing display logic from heavy math to avoid SRAM exhaustion  
- Fine-tuning serial parsing, memory usage (use of F() macros, no String, PROGMEM where needed)  
- Calibrating solar charging to work reliably under variable light  

## Outcome

A fully independent GPS navigator that **never runs out of battery** and delivers **map-ready UTM coords**, formatted for integration with IGN hiking cards. It‚Äôs become my **trusted companion** on trails, and a first step in the world of embedded systems.
