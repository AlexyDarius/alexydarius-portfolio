This project marks the **starting point of my journey as a web developer**, built for my family's pizzeria. It's a modern, responsive showcase website with a custom CMS, allowing them to manage their menu and opening hours without any technical skills.

## Overview

Darius Pizza is a dynamic brochure site designed to promote the family-run pizzeria and offer an intuitive admin interface to manage pizza listings, prices, and business hours. It was my first real-world full-stack project ‚Äî built from scratch, with passion and a strong focus on usability.

## Key Achievements

- üì± Fully responsive site live since 2022  
- üîê Simple and secure admin interface  
- üçï Dynamic pizza menu with real-time editing  
- üïí CMS-powered opening hours and contact info  

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Pizza Menu**: Menu displayed by category with price, description, and the ability to edit from the admin dashboard.
- **Custom CMS**: Lightweight content management system for updating pizzas, prices, hours, and contact details.
- **Contact Section**: Contact form with clear instructions (orders by phone only).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences.
- **Local Visibility**: Strengthened the pizzeria's online presence with a professional, user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Clean, responsive front-end foundation.
- **Node.js / Express**: Back-end logic and API for content management and authentication.
- **MySQL**: Structured database for pizzas, hours, and contact data.
- **EJS (or alternative)**: Server-side rendering for dynamic content.
- **Shared Hosting**: Custom domain deployed at `dariuspizza.fr`.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a tool for non-technical users taught me how to:

- Structure a full-stack app from scratch
- Design intuitive interfaces with minimal clutter
- Handle authentication and secure content editing
- Deploy a stable, production-ready website

## Outcome

The site has been running smoothly since 2022 and is still actively used by my parents to manage their business. It's brought them greater independence and local reach. For me, it represents a foundational, deeply personal project ‚Äî the first real step into full-stack web development.
