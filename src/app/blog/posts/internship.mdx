## A Systems Engineer at the Heart of Innovation

Internships in the aerospace sector rarely position you at the convergence of innovation, regulation, and industrial pragmatism. Mine did. For six months, I served as a Systems Engineering (SE) intern at H3 Dynamics, a start-up working to redefine how aviation is powered—with hydrogen at its core.

While the backdrop was cutting-edge technology and rapid development, my mission was foundational: to define and implement a systems engineering framework capable of supporting the company's ambitions toward aircraft certification and sustainable growth. 

This meant embedding structure in a high-speed, high-stakes environment where every decision could shape the future of zero-emission aviation.

## Context: Between Certification and Agility

H3 Dynamics, though rooted in innovation, operates in a domain where safety, traceability, and regulatory alignment are non-negotiable. The company needed to evolve from intuitive and reactive workflows toward mature, methodical processes to meet standards such as those defined by EASA's Design Organization Approval (DOA) framework.

Yet, the company’s size and dynamism demanded that this evolution be light, flexible, and deeply pragmatic. This contradiction—certification-level rigor with start-up speed—was the systems engineering challenge I stepped into.

My assignment: design and partially deploy an SE approach that would be immediately useful, strategically scalable, and seamlessly integrated into the technical and managerial ecosystem of the company.

## Mission: Architecting the Systems Engineering Backbone

The mission was structured around two key streams:

1. **Structuring the System Lifecycle**: Building a systems engineering workflow aligned with international standards (e.g., ARP-4754A, ISO 15288), from stakeholder needs to product retirement.
2. **Implementing Tools and Templates**: Delivering concrete, usable assets—process maps, document templates, requirements tracking tools, and validation matrices—to support engineers in day-to-day project delivery.

The approach was deliberately iterative. I used a combination of standards analysis, team interviews, engineering observation, and system modeling to ensure the result would be both compliant and human-centric.

## Methodology: Listening, Modeling, Integrating

Early in the internship, I focused on diagnosing the current state of engineering practices across active projects. This diagnostic phase involved:

- Participating in technical meetings and test campaigns.
- Mapping out existing information flows, decisions, and documentation habits.
- Identifying gaps in requirements traceability, verification logic, and interface definition.

From there, I began modeling a Systems Engineering workflow that accounted for both regulatory expectations and the team’s operational realities. Rather than importing rigid methods, I tailored frameworks to H3 Dynamics’ working culture.

This included:

- **Process Modeling**: Defining a development lifecycle segmented into gate-based phases (Concept, Preliminary Design, Detailed Design, Verification, and Certification Support).
- **Workflow Integration**: Embedding SE checkpoints into existing planning and review cycles.
- **Asset Design**: Creating flexible, editable templates for specifications, interface control documents, validation plans, and anomaly reports.

## Tools Built: From Concepts to Action

A core part of my impact was operationalizing SE theory through tooling. Two internal utilities were particularly impactful:

- **Requirement Management Tool**: A requirements management tool built to help teams define, link, and validate requirements across the product lifecycle. It supported bidirectional traceability and interfaced with design documentation.
- **FCS Data Processor**: A lightweight analysis utility for parsing test data, detecting anomalies, and supporting post-test validation review.

These tools were designed to offer high value with low adoption friction. By minimizing input overhead and integrating with existing file systems and workflows, they increased the likelihood of real-world usage.

## Testing and Validation Involvement

Although my role was process-oriented, I was also involved in on-site technical activities. This included:

- Supporting the setup and execution of system-level test campaigns.
- Drafting test procedures and validation protocols.
- Participating in fault analysis sessions following test anomalies.

These experiences were crucial in grounding the processes I designed in real operational needs. It allowed me to validate assumptions, fine-tune templates, and better advocate for SE adoption across the team.

## Key Outcomes

By the end of the internship, the following had been delivered and validated in real contexts:

- A documented SE process lifecycle, aligned with aerospace and systems engineering standards.
- A library of process templates adopted by project teams.
- An internal guide for V&V planning and risk-based requirement allocation.
- Custom-built tools for requirements and data analysis.
- A process roadmap toward certification-readiness and engineering scalability.

This foundation positioned the company to grow its technical organization without compromising traceability or compliance, paving the way for a more streamlined and certifiable design process.

## Professional Takeaways

This experience shaped my view of what it means to be a systems engineer in a high-innovation context. I learned:

- **How to balance structure and speed**, embedding process without stifling creativity.
- **How to lead cross-functional change**, gaining buy-in from teams through listening and iterative design.
- **How to translate standards into strategy**, ensuring that compliance becomes a competitive advantage rather than a burden.
- **How to deliver value through tools**, designing assets people actually use, not just admire.

Systems engineering is often seen as heavy, abstract, or bureaucratic. I’ve learned that it can be agile, human-centric, and transformative—especially in start-ups trying to scale serious, safety-critical products.

## Final Reflections

My time at H3 Dynamics was more than an internship. It was an immersion into the future of clean aviation, where the ambition of sustainable propulsion meets the rigor of aerospace engineering.

I’m proud to have contributed not just as a support engineer, but as a systems strategist—someone who helped build the scaffolding on which future innovation can safely grow.
